"""Per-turn terminal scope: profile-scoped TERMINAL_* policy.

The multiplexing gateway (and the unified dashboard/TUI, and cron) serve
several Hermes profiles from one process. Terminal settings were historically
mirrored into the process-global ``os.environ`` (first writer wins), so the
first profile to touch the terminal after startup pinned its backend — and
every other setting — onto all later turns: a ``local`` profile silently
executing inside another profile's docker sandbox, or the reverse (a sandbox
escape). Mirrors the isolation seam that ``agent/secret_scope.py`` provides
for credentials: a ContextVar holds the active profile's COMPLETE effective
``TERMINAL_*`` policy, installed at each in-process profile boundary.

Two contracts distinguish this from a plain override dict:

- **Authoritative projection.** While a scope is bound, ``terminal_env``
  resolves ONLY from that policy (built from defined defaults + the profile's
  ``.env`` + its ``config.yaml`` explicit keys). Omitted keys resolve to the
  defined default — never to ambient ``os.environ`` — so a routed profile can
  neither inherit nor be escaped onto the launch process's mounts, SSH
  targets, or resource policy (#68559).
- **Fail closed.** If the profile's policy cannot be resolved (unreadable or
  malformed ``.env``/``config.yaml``), the install raises
  :class:`TerminalPolicyUnavailable` and callers must install a *refusal*
  scope; terminal execution under a refusal scope is rejected outright
  rather than falling back to ambient authority.
