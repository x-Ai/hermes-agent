# Two things have to line up for the keepalive to actually keep anything alive.
#
# 1. The tick has to be frequent enough to see the credential before it dies.
#    Nous credential lifetimes are not fixed: this varies by account, and
#    installs have been observed at both ~3594s and ~899s. The tick therefore
#    derives from the lifetime the server actually issued rather than assuming
#    an hour, capped by the configured interval and floored so a pathological
#    lifetime cannot spin the thread.
#
# 2. The refresh has to fire while the tick can still act on it. The refresh
#    only triggers once a credential is within a skew window of expiry, so a
#    tick spaced wider than that window steps straight over it. The keepalive
#    widens the window to "will this credential outlive my next tick?" instead
#    of the request-path default of 120s. Without this, ticking faster only
#    narrows the gap; it never closes it.
#
# The original 6-hour tick against a one-hour credential failed both tests, so
# in practice every hour expired reactively into a 401 plus a re-auth retry.
